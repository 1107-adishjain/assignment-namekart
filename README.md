Notes App & RAG Pipeline
This repository contains two main components:

A full-stack Notes Application built with a React frontend and a FastAPI backend.

A Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) pipeline that demonstrates how to enhance a Large Language Model (LLM) with external knowledge.

1. Notes Application (React + FastAPI)
This is a modern, full-stack web application that allows users to sign up, log in, and perform CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations on their notes securely.

Features
User Authentication: Secure user registration and login using JWT (JSON Web Tokens).

CRUD for Notes: Authenticated users can create, view, update, and delete their own notes.

Optimistic Locking: Prevents race conditions and lost updates when multiple clients try to edit the same note simultaneously.

Tech Stack
Backend: FastAPI, Python, PostgreSQL

Frontend: React, Tailwind CSS

... (and other libraries listed in requirements.txt and package.json)

Setup & Running the Backend (FastAPI)
Navigate to the Backend Directory:

bash
cd backend
Create and Activate a Virtual Environment:

bash
# Create the environment
python -m venv venv

# Activate on macOS/Linux
source venv/bin/activate

# Activate on Windows
source venv/Scripts/activate
Install Dependencies:

bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
Run the Server:

bash
uvicorn app.main:app --reload
The backend server is now running. You can view the interactive API documentation at http://127.0.0.1:8000/docs.

2. RAG Pipeline
This script demonstrates how to build a simple RAG pipeline using LangChain. It uses a local text file as a knowledge base to answer questions, making the LLM's responses more accurate and context-aware.

How It Works
Load: A local text file (data/knowledge_base.txt) is loaded.

Chunk: The text is split into smaller, manageable chunks.

Embed & Store: Each chunk is converted into a numerical vector (embedding) and stored in a FAISS vector store for efficient searching.

Retrieve: When a question is asked, the pipeline retrieves the most relevant chunks from the vector store.

Generate: The question and the retrieved context are passed to an LLM (GPT-3.5 Turbo) to generate a final answer.

Setup & Running the RAG Pipeline
Navigate to the Project Directory:

bash
cd rag-pipeline # Or your main project folder
Create and Activate a Virtual Environment:
Follow the same steps as for the backend to create and activate a venv.

Install Dependencies:

bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
Set Your OpenAI API Key:

Create a file named .env in the project root.

Add your API key to this file:

text
OPENAI_API_KEY="your_sk_key_here"
Create the Knowledge Base:
The script requires a knowledge base file to read from.

bash
# Create the directory
mkdir data

# Create the file with some content
echo "The primary mitigation for a lost update race condition is optimistic locking." > data/knowledge_base.txt
Run the Script:

bash
python main.py
The script will execute the pipeline and print the user's question and the LLM's generated answer to the terminal.
